# Free Golf Coach

Free golf site is a library for useful golf tutorial videos for golfers of all levels. 
Users of this site will have a passion for golf and for sharing useful tutorials they have found online. 
As site owner, I want to create a space/community for people who love golf and sharing their favourite tutorials.
Ultimately, I would like this to be a content management site where users can share the content of others or post their own content.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Responsive navbar has been included on all three pages. Includes links to Logo, Home, Long Game and Short Game pages.

## Deployment
