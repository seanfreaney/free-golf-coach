# Free Golf Coach

Free golf site is a library for useful golf tutorial videos for golfers of all levels. 
Users of this site will have a passion for golf and for sharing useful tutorials they have found online. 
As site owner, I want to create a space/community for people who love golf and sharing their favourite tutorials.
Ultimately, I would like this to be a content management site where users can share the content of others or post their own content.

### Additional features
- __CMS__
  - Ultimately, I would like to create a content management site but don't yet possess the skills. I want to give users the ability to have their own page, upload and interact with content.

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- __HTML__
  - No errors returend through W3C validator.

- __CSS__
  - No errors returned through jigsaw validator.

### Unfixed Bugs
- __Video Content__
  - I would like to add additional styling to video containers. I want to only show one video in each container at a time and allow users to scroll through to their preferred video.
