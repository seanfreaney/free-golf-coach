# Free Golf Coach

Free golf site is a library for useful golf tutorial videos for golfers of all levels. 
Users of this site will have a passion for golf and for sharing useful tutorials they have found online. 
As site owner, I want to create a space/community for people who love golf and sharing their favourite tutorials.
Ultimately, I would like this to be a content management site where users can share the content of others or post their own content. 

## Existing Features

### Navbar
- __Navigation Bar__

  - Responsive navbar has been included on all three pages. Includes links to Logo, Home, Long Game and Short Game pages.
  - Bottom border to show user their current location in the site.
  - Dropdown menu for smaller screens.

### Home Page Image
- __Home Page Image__

  - Responsive textbox overlay. Opacity used for contrast while not disturbing the image

### Community
- __Community__

  - Community banner in keeping with navbar. (used H1 element to ensure text in keeping with header).

  - Responsively styled footer section containing external links to all relevant social media sites.

### Long Game Image
- __Long Game Image__
  - Image of golfer at top of their follow-through with a scenic background. Found on www.freepik.com.
  - This image was used as it is from the same creator as the Home page and Short Game image. It is difficult to find golf related images with a central focal point and similar colors.

### Video Content

  - They are on a responsive div and include a scrollbar for ease of use.

### Short Game Image

  - Image of golfer in a bunker with a scenic background. Found on www.freepik.com.
  - This image was used as it is from the same creator as the Home page and Long Game image. It is difficult to find golf related images with a central focal point and similar colors.
  - Responsive textbox overlay. Opacity used for contrast while not disturbing the image

### Additional features
- __CMS__
  - Ultimately, I would like to create a content management site but don't yet possess the skills. I want to give users the ability to have their own page, upload and interact with content.

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- __HTML__
  - No errors returend through W3C validator.

- __CSS__
  - No errors returned through jigsaw validator.

### Unfixed Bugs
- __Video Content__
  - I would like to add additional styling to video containers. I want to only show one video in each container at a time and allow users to click an arrow to scroll through to their preferred video.(I did some research and this required javascript).


## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
